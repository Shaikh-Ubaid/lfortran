semantic error: Rank mismatch in array reference: the array `str` has rank `1`, but is referenced as rank `2`
 --> tests/errors/array_06.f90:5:5

5 |     str(1, 2)(:) = '1234'
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^

  This is a temporary line.
  One can simply alter the reference outputs and this is not detected by the CI.
